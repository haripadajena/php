## What is the Repository Pattern?

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern used to separate the business logic from the data access logic. It encapsulates the details of how data is retrieved, stored, or modified, allowing developers to interact with a consistent API without worrying about the underlying database operations.

### Benefits:
- Simplifies the codebase by centralizing data logic.
- Facilitates easier testing and maintenance.
- Enhances code reusability and scalability.
